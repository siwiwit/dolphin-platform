/**
 * <p>Annotation to define a Dolphin controller. A Dolphin Controller is the server side controller of a MVC group / widget.
 * When using Dolphin Plaftorm your application is seperated in a hirarchie of several MVC groups. Each MVC group defines
 * a client side view, a server side controller and a model that is automatically shared between the client and server.
 * <br>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/model-sync.png" alt="model is synchronized between client and server"></center>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each dolphin controller must be annotated with {@link com.canoo.dolphin.server.DolphinController}.
 * A dolphin controller will automatically managed by the container (spring or JavaEE) and the lifecycle
 * of the controller is bound to the view lifecycle. A server site controller will be automatically created
 * when a macthing controller proxy is created at the client. This means that you can have several instances of
 * a dolphin controller on the server, one for each matching view instance. This will happen if several clients use the
 * same view or a view is shown several times in a client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since the controller instances are managed by the platform you can use all teh default annotations and APIs
 * that are supported by the Platform like {@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct} or {@link javax.inject.Inject}.
 * In addition Dolphin Platform supports some custom annotations that can be used in a controller:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.canoo.dolphin.server.DolphinModel}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.canoo.dolphin.server.DolphinAction}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.canoo.dolphin.server.Param}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal @}DolphinController("my-controller")
 *     public class MyController {
 *
 *          {@literal @}DolphinModel
 *          private MyModel model;
 *
 *         {@literal @}DolphinAction()
 *         private void onAction() { . . . };
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>
